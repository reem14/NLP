They take our order but tells us they don't serve cups of water there. So we are a little annoyed but ok we shrug it off and wait our turn to pay and receive our order.

9,"This McDonald's has gotten much better. Usually my order would be wrong every single time so I would not leave that window until I checked every single item. I only hit up fast food once a month or so and it needs to be worth it. Also the fries used to be cold and the cheese on the burger was never melted. Everything was just lukewarm. Now my order has been right a few times in a row and my food hot. Also, I love dining room. Usually you wouldn't find me actually inside a fast food joint but this place has nice flooring, stacked stone, lots of large windows and a flat screen TV usually on HLN.

In food quality and employee humanity/work effortTypically, I do NOT eat McDonalds food; yet similar to the experience of others ""trapped"" at Northside Hospital there is no other option if you are hungry outside of the hospital cafeteria hours of operation.

However, last night, for the first time I ordered food (grilled chicken salad) I returned it ~ the meat smelled BADLY. This did not surprise me and only enforced my resolve to avoid chain food restaurants.What did surprise me and absolutely SHOCKED me was the customer service offered by employees ~ HOW in the world can you BE an employee here and NOT for ONE MINUTE or even a second acknowledge the obvious FACT that you work inside a HOSPITAL; then consider what that means for each and every person that approaches your counter to order.

Yes, it even showed it on your fancy digital menu. Then they would ask me to pull up and wait 10 minutes for my order to be corrected. My bf and I went inside once to order and they got his order wrong. The woman just stood there and looked at us when we told her and my bf was like, ""...but I guess I can eat this"". Later when we went up and asked for sauce, she gave us the biggest eyeroll upon seeing us and acted like it was physically painful for her to serve us.

They're also generous with the condiments when you ask for them (and even when you don't!).

187,"Years of pathetic service, disgusting food, and dangerous mistakes. Why do I keep going back?Having nothing to do with Mcdonalds food in general and more to do with the ability of this specific location to produce it with out killing anybody. I have been going to this particular store for years. It is right around the corner from where I used to live, and is on the way from where I live to pretty much everything I use (gas station, costco, movie theater, market, etc). It is the only convenient location, and for a while Mcdonalds was the only place that had $1 drinks. So those are my lame excuses for repeatedly torturing myself with this horrible place! Service: I used to be a manager with another fast food chain. I know what service SHOULD be. I also know what it usually is. It doesn't have to be 5 star. But the rude attitudes, ridiculously slow service, and inability to get a single order right is really a bit too much. When I say slow service, I am talking 15 minutes is average drive thru time for a dollar menu burger and a soda. Correct orders: Yes, my order can occasionally be complicated (no castup, add big mac sauce)... but when I thought they could do no worse... they messed up an order for 4 large drinks. 2 diet cokes, a lemonade, and an unsweet iced tea (all with extra ice). We received a regular coke, a lemonade, a Dr. Pepper, and a sweet iced tea. 2 drinks had no ice at all. and the other 2 had a few pieces floating around. We have never received a correct order from this store. EVER. I could go on and on about it, but I will stick with this sad example and move on.Dangerous/disgusting/incorrectly made: Something a little different then an order where they put the wrong thing in the bag or mess up a custom, is when they just make it incorrectly or dangerously. Some of the examples of this include pies that expired an hour before I received them, an egg that was completely raw in the middle, and tonights lovely mess up. Tonight I ordered the Angus Mushroom and Swiss. According to the website this should include 2 full slices of swiss cheese and a decent amount of mushrooms. I had about a teaspoon of mushrooms, no sauce, and 1/2 a slice of cheese. That is right, they left off a slice and a half of cheese! In addition, it was a regular (and relatively old) quarter pound patty, not the big ole angus patty they should have used. I have called the number on the receipt multiple times that takes me to the district office. They consistently send out a free sandwich or drink coupon to apologize. They tell me how sorry they are and suggest I try one of their other locations, as this is the only one they receive complaints from. From what I was told they are revamping this store, but I have been told that for well over a year, and it seems to have been unvamped and going down hill, which I didn't think was even possible! I keep vowing this will be my last visit, but then find myself sitting in the drive thru line yet again wondering if I will ever receive my food. I highly do not recommend this location. Hopefully you won't be lured in by whatever the heck keeps luring me! -Sarah (This was written by Paul's wife because I am usually the one dealing with them. I guess he got smarter.)","Years pathetic service, disgusting food, dangerous mistakes. Why I keep going back?Having nothing Mcdonalds food general ability specific location produce killing anybody.

She has the worst attitude out of all the workers there and it is clear that she hates her job. She is just not friendly at all and can never get an order right.

I waited about 15 seconds for my drinks, and he was awkwardly standing there, wondering why I didn't drive off yet. Then he asked, ""Are you waiting for something else? That should be it."" I said, ""...We ordered drinks too."" He looks behind him and there are my drinks! ""Oh!"" he exclaims. As I am situating the drinks into my cup holders, I hear him say, ""Here."" When I turn around towards the window, half of his arm is in my car and the straws almost hit my face! WTF?! I was so irritated by his incompetency.

263,"I never thought I would write a review of a McDonalds, much less have to write a negative review for a McDonald's. I don't even know how it's possible that a McDonald's could be so bad but unfortunately this one is. ξ Like many people, I have eaten at McDonalds all over America and even in several other countries. ξI have to say this is probably one of the worst McDonald's I've ever been to other than the one in Manila in the Philippines -and that's only because I'm not sure that what was in those burgers was even beef.Where do I begin? The service is terrible. I have never, not ONE time, gotten what I ordered. I get sweet tea when I ask for unsweetened. I get cheese when I ask for none. I get onions when I ask for none. I get 2 chicken sandwiches when I ask for 4 apple pies. ξI have given up on going through the drive thru because I always end up having to pull around, park, go in and wait in the long line of teenagers getting shakes ξjust to get them to correct my order. And even then, they don't get it right and I actually have to tell them, ""No see, this is a Chicken Sandwich, I ordered a McDouble.""The food is almost always cold. The burgers are dry and taste like they have been sitting on a shelf for more than an hour. And the fry's..ugh! When there are 6 cars in the drive thru and 20 people in line, I just don't understand how the fry's can be cold and stale. It absolutely defies logic. Yes, there are times that the food comes out hot. It's one of the reasons I keep going back. There's nothing like hot Fry's from McDonalds.. and also, just because it's McDonald's. Like it or not, it's a staple for working parents too tired to cook dinner after work some nights. It is unfortunate that they have no competition in the immediate area to keep them on their toes, otherwise they might actually try to improve their service and their product. I am sure they are turning a profit. No doubt. It seems to always be busy. However, I truly believe that if ANY other burger joint opened up right next door, this place would close down in a month. Every time I say I'm never going back, I still do. Unfortunately, tonight will be one of those nights as the kids specifically requested it. The shear dread of what I'm about to go through is what prompted this review. ξI really hope they improve.

290,"I was so excited for this McDonalds to open, it's about time we get a food place in that location. So you can imagine my disappointment with their terrible service and bad quality food making!! Worst. Worst. Worst. I get they are new. I do, so the first few times I went, I kept my cool, didn't complain, smiled, etc. I like to go mid-morning on my way to work for either just coffee and a Sausage McMuffin with no egg... How complicated of an order can it be??!! Sometimes I will mix it up and get a combo meal, this is usually where they royally screw it up. I'm irritated just thinking about the visits Ive had and how 4 out of 5 visits they screwed something up. To make this brief, here are my major issues. I order Splenda to be added to my drink. I'm in my work clothes, and I don't want to pull over and carefully add it myself and spill on my clothes since they A) they always fill it too high, and B) I don't want to make any more stops! Cheese: hardly ever melted on the Quarter Pounder, or Big Mac and I've tried about 3 or 4 times. Cheese not melted, or the tiniest blob of sauce! I wanted the new habanero ranch, couldn't even taste the sauce except for one bite! Plus it was luke-warm at least twice! The hot & spicy with a tiny splash of mayo? I mean, really! I ordered an iced Caramel Mocha, get to the window, she hands me the latte, it had no caramel on the whip, so I ask, is this the Caramel Mocha? She stares at me blankly and says yes, I say, I'm used to it having caramel on top, she says its a caramel mocha, so off to work I go, I'm already late because they are super SLOW, and sure enough take a sip after I'm gone and it's a regular mocha. Pathetic service!I did write in to corporate after my 8th or 10th attempt to do business there.. And the manager called me and apologized. Told me to come in and get a free combo on him. So not happening. Go in so they can remember me as the Girl who called them out for their shit slow service, always messing up my orders, ξand crap food making? No thanks. I would have rather had some coups sent so I could remain anonymous. Oh well. I just drive a few more blocks down to Rainbow and Blue Diamond location if i have the extra time, they are great! As for this place? Shame on you for STILL not being able to get your shit together! One positive note I will say is there are two very friendly employees there. They work the drive thru taking orders/$$ I wish I had their names! Will I be back? Sadly probably yes, it's very convenient for me on my way to work when I don't have time to go to rainbow location.. But I limit what I get, try to keep it simple and always hope for the best... Maybe someday they will be a great location... As for now? The McDonald's Corporation would be ashamed!!!","I excited McDonalds open, time get food place location.

I don't even know where to start! Besides Starbucks and Krispy Kreme this is your only option for late night eats at The Excalibur. Here it goes:Visit #1: Fool me once...shame on you.My husband and I head to the room early our first night in Vegas because we were tired after a long drive. After watching some TV my husband said he wanted a little something from our local McDonalds. I was not really hungry but I was craving a little something sweet so I asked him to get me a McFlurry and to call me and tell me what kind they have. He calls and they have Oreo, M&M, and Butterfinger. YUM! I want Butterfinger I exclaimed! He hangs up and calls back about a minute later to break the news to me that they are out of Butterfinger. That would've been useful info to have when he first asked! So I ended up with Oreo. He comes back and I take a bite of my McFlurry. For those who may not know a McFlurry is soft serve icecream mixed with whatever topping you get. How do you possibly mess that up? Messing up a McFlurry is equal to the stupidity of burning cornflakes! There is no excuse. I took one bite and threw it away. The icecream was warm and the oreo chucks were stale. NASTY! My husband's burger and fries turned out ok at least. Visit #2: Fool me twice....shame on me. After some late night gambling I was hungry and did not feel like searching for late night eats so I ventured into this hell hole again. I figured since I was getting regular food this time it would be ok. The customer service of this place is atrocious. You are pretty much the only 24 hour operation that offers more than donuts and coffee so change your attitude. My husband had a sweet tooth this time and wanted a McFlurry. Dun Dun Dun! I order my food and ask for a Oreo McFlurry and the guy behind the counter proceeds to tell me that the icecream machine is locked. Excuse me? WTF? I call my hubby and tell him and he is most displeased. After two minutes of straight ξcursing he asks for chocolate chip cookies, they have none. The only had oatmeal raisin which I can only describe is the asshole of cookies. So literally they have no good desserts. So my poor baby goes without what he wants. We are not doughnut fans so Krispy Kreme is not really appealing. After that I was done with that place for good!If you are ok with McDonalds go to the one at The Luxor. You will probably get better service. We should've. ξIf you want something better venture into NYNY into America cafe which is open 24 hours and for the same price you can get some decent food and service.","On Christ almighty goes.

474,"After being opened only a couple of days, this is the newest McDonald's to open in the Las Vegas valley. In a few days there will be another McDonald's opening a few miles west at Blue Diamond and Durango. ξI just happened to have caught this McDonald's act on the way back from hiking. The Blue Diamond Road landscape seems to change every week. New to the landscape is the old familiar Golden Arches sign. After hiking for six hours I was exhausted and needed a snack. ξLately my opinion of McDonald's is that it does a better job of filling the void for a light meal, snack, Frape Mocha, or coffee if a coffee shop is not around. To temporarily hold over my appetite and enjoy a beverage besides water that I had been drinking all the day on the hike, I ordered the $1 large Coke and $1 hot & spicy. ξBeing a new McDonalds this location is modern and for now immacuately clean. First off it is a nice first impression when a McDonald's is not part of a gas station, like the one down the road at Blue Diamond and Rainbow. I entered through modern electric sliding doors. There were two managers, and I got a nice greeting. The workers were on top of their game. There were plenty of booths to choose from. The interior is more contemporary than McDonald Land. The McDonald Playland is nonexistent. What does exist is a chandelier and a more elegant lobby. They did not go modern to the point of some restaurants that feature the super Coke machines with a 100 plus flavors. The typical Coke flavors they had were not flat. McDonald's may not be 4 star dining. However, when I just want a snack to fill me up or a Frape Caramel; McDonald's gets the job done. The Daniel. S Yelp 100 Challenge.

Not this time. Now, if you would like a refill, it is $0.54. I was really tempted to break out the credit card to pay for a refill, just out of spite. Laziness prevailed and I walked away.

I can remember my order for extra onions on McRib sandwiches or hamburgers have been produced with extra pickles and no onions. A recent visit took 25 minutes to produce a 10 piece chicken mcnuggets and a soda. I've worked at a McDonald's before, and if I had a valid food card, and ambassadorial privileges, I could have changed the oil, re-heat the fryer, located a box in their freezer, and fry my own food, and still get to school on time. The shift manager gave me a large fries and 2 cups for drinks, not being sensitive to the fact that I had diabetes, and I had ordered nuggets for speedy service and avoidance of excess carbs.The service today was not as bad, but why do they go through the trouble of asking what kind of sauce do I want with my nuggets if they aren't going to give it to me?

Yelp wants me to write the review and I am tired of seeing this when I go on the welcome screen. So, I will write a review on the McDonald's in Sam's Town. ξWhen I write a review I try to look at a unique aspect of the business. When it comes to fast food restaurants, it takes some thinking. What makes this McDonald's unique is that it features the exact Western motif displayed throughout Sam's Town. It is incorporated in a food court in back of the mountain where the robotic Mystic Falls robotic animals perform. I don't know of any McDonald's where I could grab a Big Mac and fries and watch a robotic cast of animals performing in a laser show, What also makes this McDonald;s unique for a location off the Strip is that they do not honor the $1 Any Size Beverage promotion. ξThe Sam's Town McDonald's is one of a few food choices in Sam's Town. In my opinion I pass over their coffee and dessert for Dunkin Donuts. I pass over their lunch and dinner menu for the Firelight Buffet, Panda Express, and Subway. For my tastes, this McDonald's is advantageous for a light snack or a Large Coke for the drive home. The time I spend on the line justifies a check-in. It is the McDonald's of Sam's Town, and it gets busy. In comparison to a similar McDonald's in the D casino, the employees are friendly. This summarizes my experiences for the Sam's Town McDonald's.

589,"McDonald's is McDonald's. Not much to say when you write a review about it, other than specifics. Here goes.The outside is decorated very nicely. There is a VERY spacious patio area with an HDTV you can watch games on. It is situated directly adjacent to a very large soccer field that is often used. Unfortunately, this means that at night, during games and practices, the parking lot is mostly full due to people parking there for their games.Do not let the parking lot fool you if there is a game in progress. It's probably not very packed at all.Another thing relates to the free wifi. They have the power outlets inside ONLY under a large HD tv where they have 4 comfortable chairs set up. This tells me they only want people using the internet over there and not at the tables, keeping the tables open. From a business perspective, this is smart. From a me being annoyed when I can't use my computer for a long time at a table perspective, this sucked.My air conditioner went out one day and I needed a place to work (I work from home). I went to this McDonald's and had so slump over my laptop all day under a TV blaring ESPN.Also, this place fills up right after the nearby high school lets out in the afternoon and stayed this way for a couple of hours until the parents picked most of the children up. They even have a rent-a-cop during this time who looked like he hated his life.The people working the counter are usually very polite when I go, which is usually at night.

If a customer asks for a refund after waiting over 25 minutes for a 4 piece nugget meal for their kid, your managers should show some sort of logic when dealing with upset people; maybe asking for the reason why a refund is being requested; maybe even go so far as to motivate the employees to not spend the majority of their shift texting on their phones.2. If your staff cannot handle the business from the counter AND the drive through at the same time, maybe NOT such a good idea to ADD another drive through lane; another way to slam the staff with orders they cannot fill within a reasonable time!3. In the process of remodeling any of your locations and there is no regular restaurant seating, a suggestion to accommodate your customers during this temporary situation would be to keep the Play Place seating open until close so customers have a place to eat in.There are many more i could give but here are just a few suggestions from 3 separate visits in hopes the reason for this kind of service is due to you guys not knowing what goes on in this restaurant.","I apologize ahead time owners giving bad publicity McDonald's times I visited location, I one good experience. 3 points Double K consider:1.

666,"This is the only McDonald's near my work and probably for everyone else unless you you drive south into DT Portland or go across the bridge. Tried to give this place a chance after a couple of screw ups but I just can't do it anymore. And here's why.One, look at the storefront photo. I uploaded that photo here at the time of this review but it was originally taken early in the year (mainly because I had another bad experience and I need to tell everyone not to come here any more because they suck.)So the first time, as the photo shows, a dead small black fly on the lettuce in my Classic Crispy Chicken Sandwich. I usually order it without mayo and when I got my sandwich the 1st time, guess what? It had mayo. I just don't get why they can't read instructions properly or anything. Why can't the condiment be separate and not default? It's so frustrating. Any way, 2nd time I got the sandwich, they ""got it right"" except for the fly part. I already went in my car so I said ""F it"" so I just took the picture as proof and then ripped the contaminated area on the lettuce.I didn't go to this location for awhile after this incident, but I was craving Chicken McNuggets and so since it isn't a fresh produce item or whatever, I decided it wouldn't be a big deal. Boy was I wrong. I think this might have happened twice but I counted my nuggets and it was missing 1 in the 10 or 20 piece meal. I shouldn't have to count how many nuggets I have, but sadly these people can't do their job. I don't even get much time to eat lunch so I didn't have time to go back and complain. I'm done with this location any way so if I'm craving a sandwich or Chicken McNuggets from here, I'll just drive across the bridge and go there because it probably isn't crap like this location. They know they are serving a ton of people since they are the only location but they just do such a bad job. The fries are a bit overpriced too and some other things in case any of you were thinking you can get a decent deal on Large Fries. The best place for that would be the Beaverton location near Uwajimaya off highway 10 (I think that's it.)Conclusion: If you crave McDonalds, don 't go to this location unless you want dead flies in ξyour burgers/sandwiches or missing Chicken McNuggets.","This McDonald's near work probably everyone else unless drive south DT Portland go across bridge.

708,"I stopped at this location with my boyfriend earlier this evening to grab a bite to eat after stopping off to pick up some things for his apartment and this was one of the most ghetto McD's I've been to. I've seen some pretty bad places, but this place took the cake in terms of filth and vagrancy because the place seemed to be a location for people to loiter around in and having people up in there begging for change and all while you're trying to order your food. I was waiting with my fiance for his food to come up and the guy behind the counter was banging his hand saying ""can I help the next customer"".....really you think you can get someone's attention banging your hand on the counter like some ignorant fool with no professional standards. Who would want to eat in this place with folks standing outside trying to sell you stuff and this one guy was begging for change to allegedly feed his baby sister.....that's so typical for them to sit there and lie because they want someone to give them money so they can feed their whatever habit they're trying to hide. This restaurant is situated in one of the most ghetto neighborhoods on the west side which says how the standards has gone down. If they really cared they would keep the restaurant clean inside and outside and I was glad that I didn't see the inside of the bathroom because if it's a ghetto McDonalds the bathrooms wouldnt exactly look like they were maintained well either.

Yes, yes, it is unhealthy, but sometimes you just want that extra wink of sleep or two!Over the year and a half span of working in this area, I hit the drive-thru up perhaps a dozen times. Out of those twelve visits, about half of them had issues with my order.Here are the issues I can remember:* Smaller sized smoothie than I paid for* Not including ketchup when requested* Not including hot sauce when requested* Not including napkins when requested (yes, people eat out of their cars!)* Giving me someone else's orderThose are just the issues I remembered, but there were probably others. I never actually went inside to complain, as these pit stops were right before I had to open my business in the morning. With a 50-50 chance of getting your order right, that just seems poor listening skills. I hope the management takes note of this.If you do want a better sit-down breakfast or lunch, try the JK's restaurant about two blocks east on Wolf and Saint Charles.

713,"I do not normally go to McDonalds but I saw a line of cars in the drive through and thought this place must be excellent to have so many clamoring for their food. Upon entering this establishment I came upstairs n their varied many and perused the items hoping upon hope that they had Foie gras as I had a taste for the liver of a goose. It was not to be found. They must be animal rights activists that run this establishment. I asked the young girl at the counter what their speciality was and she told me the Big Mac was one of their finer dishes. I placed the order along with some French fries, I no longer call them freedom fries now that the French have come fully on board with our war against Muslim countries #jesuischarlie I wonder how these French fries will be served, I am imagining they will be garnished with black truffles . I ask for their wine list and am told they do not have one. How peculiar for a restaurant that serves French food. To my horror no baguettes either. My food bill comes to 6.30 cents. Imagine that, the Big Mac meal , their finest offering and it is only just over 6 dollars. The wait is not long for my entree, so glad I did not ask for their freedom onion soup. Strangely the food is in a box and a carton. This must be a new style , the creativity of chefs these days knows no bounds. I am impressed. I open up the box and there lies this lettucey thing with some kind of salad dressing on it. It is cold and damp. This must be an artistic statement of some kind. Possibly a commentary on the ill treatment of the Intuit natives at the turn of the last century. I am impressed by the chefs social concerns but I had wished that the food was hot. I took a bite . I am glad that I sat close to the toilet as I made a run for it. They must have been upset that I ordered the foie gras originally. They are making me pay for it. I know when I have been defeated. My pomme frites were hot but lacking any French accoutrements. This must be French cooking under the Vichy government when the Germans took away their cream and tried to make them eat sausages.

770,"Today was the breaking point. Long ago, McDonald's revolutionized the restaurant industry with fast food dining, a paragon of what was possible when human ingenuity applied itself to streamline processes and deliver maximum production and food for people in the least amount of time. These days, efficiency no longer matters and has been replaced with indifference, complacency, and a lack of disregard to customer priorities. On most mornings, I will stop into McDonald's to grab a yogurt parfait for $1.12 as my morning breakfast. I did it because it was a healthy breakfast, tasted good, and was amazingly cheap. Before today, one of the top ten things I associate with McDonald's is efficiency, and today I can throw that word out the window because McDonald's no longer merits it.Today I left my house early for the express purpose of ordering more food for breakfast because I didn't have dinner and I was short on sleep and needed a giant coffee to go with some food to keep me sane for a long day at work. I arrived at 8:44am and I know this because Foursquare told me so when I checked in! Something was amiss and there was a large crowd of people and lines that were simply not moving.Great, these things sometimes happen, which was why I was glad that I left my house early so that if I actually did have to wait in line it wouldn't matter and I'd still be able to get what I wanted when I wanted it. The minutes started flying by and the line still wasn't moving! What happened to that proud tradition of corporate efficiency to deliver the customer what they wanted when they wanted with the highest degree of professionalism and courtesy? Well you can all forget about it because it's clear that no one in this McDonald's during the morning shift gives one iota of care for anyone waiting in line.I got to be the third person in line when two customers started to argue with the cashier that they wanted cream on the side of their coffee and not mixed in. The clerk wouldn't make a new coffee for the customers and the customers weren't having any of it. Watching these people argue with the clerk got my blood boiling because I was trying to get an order in and get to work on time! ξBecause of the inability of the clerk to placate these customers I ended up stuck in line waiting, waiting, and waiting in what seemed to be forever!Having arrived at 8:44am, it was now 8:54am and I hadn't made an order! I yelled in frustration about the utter lack of disregard the staff had much to the amusement of the other patrons who were all either waiting for their order or waiting to order who all were in the same boat. I slammed the door on leaving and walked a block over to Starbucks. At Starbucks I spent $5 for a giant cup of coffee and no food - $5 I could have easily spent at McDonald's in order to get what I wanted, but apparently McDonald's no longer cares about earning my money since they are too busy arguing with other customers and making everyone wait to order and wait for their food. Long gone are the good old days of the quick food restaurant, this McDonald's no longer adheres to any sense of time or service and has degenerated into the ultimate display of incompetency. There are not enough words in all of the languages I speak to describe the disgust that I experienced today at this McDonald's. It was disgraceful and a thorough exercise in human futility and it was ten minutes of my life that I will never gain back.","Today breaking point.

But before I could stand up and head on over to the counter I was approached by I believe the manager who didn't start off by saying ""Welcome to McDonalds..."" I instead got, ""Have you ordered yet?"", ""You can only be here 30 minutes"", and went into some speech about ordering, customers and length of time to be there??? I was like WTH? I told them I AM a customer, and in fact ξwas just there hours earlier for breakfast and before I could say that I AM going to order they tapped on the wall as if to say ""you gotta go"" and walked away after giving me the third degree and truly made me feel unwelcomed.

I DO NOT LOITER and was quite offended that this person insinuated that. ξIn fact, I always order and take it home except this day I did sit for a a minute ( and earlier at breakfast I ordered my usual grub and sat maybe 5-7 minutes and took the rest home) or two as I completed my call, but I just got there and it was like this person appeared out of nowhere and started grilling me?

In my family during that time, eating at Mcdonalds was luxury item. Why was it a luxury? Because my parents highly frowned upon processed and can foods. As a rebellious child growing up, eat at a Mcdonald's was luxury. The closest place without a car had to be in McKinley Park. Fast forward a few years and the McDonald's express opened. Despite it being fastfood, it poses as a treat to all the locals in the neighborhood; after playing sports at Mcguane or just grabbing a quick bite. This Mcdonald's is very small compared to other Mcdonalds, but they do serve most items. Since they marketed their $1 menu couple of years ago, the dollar menu has never changed. McChickens and Mcdoubles were always a $1. Now with the advertised $1 breakfast menus and any size drink, there are a lot of cheap options. My only grievance is that they don't have sweet tea and salads, but unsweetened tea is available. It doesn't feel right to goto any McDonalds for a salad... it just doesn't make sense to me.I come here a couple times a month for ice coffee, hot coffee and a sandwich or two.

844,"If I were to die and go to hell, this McDonald's would certainly provide a worthy backdrop for a nightmare imagined.Let's begin the story of my worst dinner of my life at this sad little stop in a strip mall of no particular visual appeal under a bleak and cold Chicago evening. All things being fair, the culinary experience was doomed for failure given certain personal and tragic circumstances I won't get into here.Upon stepping to the counter, I gave pause to the abbreviated menu not worthy of a McDonald's Express, which is a new concept to me all-together. I decided to play it safe with the classic cheeseburger meal with an intimidating amount of fries and drink aka ""The Value Meal"". My meal was served up a little too quickly with all due credit to the server. The food seemed to appear from nowhere - gremlins cooking the food? I could see the grease seeping through one of the burger wrappers. At this point I made a snap substitution request, no coke, coffee instead - a hot beverage will make the grease go down smoother. My server obligated me in silence and I acknowledged her generosity. I took my tray and chose a seat by the front windows where parked cars would treat the diner with blinding light from their headlights, but at least it was somewhat devoid of the cold glowing light emitting from the overhead florescent located in the rear of the restaurant.I sat down and emptied the contents of the bag, fries and napkins, no ketchup. I tasted one of the fries to determine if they were worthy of ketchup-free consumption, but alas no, they were slightly cold with a texture that left an unpleasant lump in your throat. I fetched several ketchup packets from the server, kept under tight security behind the counter and returned to my table.Spilling out the ketchup packets on the table, I noticed dried droplets of ketchup on the plastic packets. No turning back now, I dug into my dinner with a overwhelming sadness for humanity and myself. So, to sum up:Fries. They left an odd taste of seafood or fish to my palette. Perhaps they co-mingled food in the fryer. The luke-warm temparture made it a bit difficult to choke them down. Maybe some beer would have helped the process.Cheeseburgers. Lifting the top bun of any burger, you can tell right away if there was any love in the preparation. Though consumable, the burgers were not satisfying and tasted as if they sat under a heat lamp for too long, also lukewarm.Coffee. I have tasted better coffee from a mechanical contraption in a corporate lunch room. It was watery, lukewarm and slightly sweet in a way that amplified everything that went wrong with the coffee.Ketchup Packets. Looks like they were dropped on the floor at some point or recycled from a previous diner that did not use up all their ketchup.Customer Service. No complaints here, it's not exactly the most cheery place to work. Servers were speedy, helpful and responsive.","If I die go hell, McDonald's would certainly provide worthy backdrop nightmare imagined.Let's begin story worst dinner life sad little stop strip mall particular visual appeal bleak cold Chicago evening.

853,"So my first experience with this McDonald's was the day that I moved in. I had a couple friends helping me. This McDonald's is directly across the street from my apartment.So, after witnessing a guy smash his van (we later were told by the po-po that it was stolen) into the light pole right at the corner, then watching him exit the vehicle and run maniacly down North Ave., away from the scene, we decided we were hungry. We thought ""why not go to McD's"". Seems logical. I mean, McD's is always the same no matter where you go, right? And it was certainly conveniently located. At least it appears conveniently located. Oh, its not. Attempting to cross North Ave. at my intersection is really a situation where you are taking your life into your hands.

I do not appreciate the game of charades I must play with the cashiers to get my order right.While you are waiting the 15 plus minutes it takes to get your food here, you may notice that this McDonalds is a bit different from the rest. Ricky Martin pictures, signed Selena CDs and gigantic Enrique Iglesias are the decor of choice here. Apparantly, this is the Latin Rock n' Roll McDonalds. Couple that with the fact that its the only McDonald's I have ever seen that has Jalepeno's as a condiment and the fact that they look at me as if I am lost every time I walk in there, I think its safe to say the clientele here is pretty set.Overall, the location, service and neighborhood sucks.

855,"Never thought I'd write a review about a McDonald's, but I feel compelled. ξThis one was just re-built, replacing a perfectly servicable old one. ξWhatever, it's their money.My problem with the new one is that its parking lot configuration and ease of ingress/egress is even more stupid than the old one, if that's possible. ξYou see, if you're coming from the east, entrance into the lot, either via entrances on North Avenue or Lowell (one way north), is no problem. ξIf you're coming from the west on North Avenue (or from the south on Kostner), you literally cannot enter the parking lot. ξAt all. I thought by turning left onto Kostner (a fairly main-drag kind of street), I could enter (as you could with the old one). ξNope. ξNo entrance any more on Kostner. ξAnd you cannot turn left from North Avenue to Lowell because there's a median (I think: either way, you're risking an accident or a ticket). ξThere's an alley directly behind the lot, which is not only fenced off from Mickey D's, but 'one way' going out. ξSo I drive AROUND THE BLOCK, past Lowell (the one-way street next to McDonald's), to Kildare, back to North Avenue, then enter. ξJesus. ξThe entrance has one of those divided-curb thingys, which was barely wide enough for my compact car. ξThere are TWO drive-thru lanes from which to order food, but then they merge into one waiting line, so you can end up in this single line ahead of someone who's been waiting longer, or vice-versa, so why bother? ξThe rest was standard McDonald's (WHY can't you at least offer me salsa for my breakfast burrito?)....I got no sauce, no ketchup, no napkins, nuthin'.OK, then to get out and go back east on North Avenue, you must basically repeat the maze-bullshit from above, only in the reverse. ξYou used to be able to exit onto Kostner, then turn left on North Avenue. ξNow you are forced to either go west on Grand or North Avenue or go to Lowell, north ξto Wabansia (past a high school) to Kildare to North Avenue. ξGot all that? ξApparently the city thinks it's more desirable for us to drive around an entire neighborhood than to use the only (inexplicably) one-way alley in the entire neighborhood to get home from fucking McDonald's. ξI felt like rat in a ghetto-maze, only with a soon-to-be-cold Egg McMuffin.So in a nutshell, if you live west of here, you can't get in. ξIf you live east of here, you can't get out. ξAnd ya can't really go north, either. ξIt's maddening. ξIf you must go to THIS McDonald's, walk or take the bus, seriously. ξFrom my house (at the halfway point between the two), I will just go down to the one at Kedzie/North. ξI realize McDonald's and/or the city are trying to protect themselves from lawsuits from our shitty driving, and that badly designed intersection, but if it's that dangerous (which it is) then just DON'T BUILD IT THERE. ξIt's a square lot, yet needlessly complicated. ξGrrr.","Never thought I'd write review McDonald's, I feel compelled. ξThis one re-built, replacing perfectly servicable old one. ξWhatever, money.My problem new one parking lot configuration ease ingress/egress even stupid old one, that's possible. ξYou see, coming east, entrance lot, either via entrances North Avenue Lowell (one way north), problem. ξIf coming west North Avenue (or south Kostner), literally cannot enter parking lot. ξAt all.

969,"THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE SHAMROCK SHAKE ONLYIt's brighter green than I remember. An extremely unnatural shade of green that doesn't occur normally in nature. For as unnatural the color is, the flavor is just as fake. I don't think there is any actual mint or dairy in these things. I think they are petroluem-based.Does it taste different than it used to? Definitely. A few years ago, McD's did the unthinkable. They ditched their old shake recipes for a new faster/cheaper/easier shake ""system"".

970,"This review screams ""First World Problems""...but until Yelp opens up a site that allows us to review establishments in the ""Third World"" (can one even still use that term without being offensive?), I guess all of the things about which we gripe will be ""First World Problems,"" won't they?Anyhow, my wife was hungry one evening so we stopped here to grab a bite to eat through the drive-thru. We actually enjoy eating at McDonald's in general and think the food is good (some people will probably find that statement more offensive than the above comments about terminology!), so it's not like this was a bad option. We actually used to stop at this one pretty often on our way home from church when we lived on the East Side and we generally received great service.Unfortunately, tonight was a night on which we received awful service.When we pulled up to the drive-through, the McDonald's employee let loose with this rapid-fire barrage that was presumably supposed to tell us what food wasn't available. I'm a teacher, and I'm used to deciphering...but this was incomprehensible. Of course, when we mistakingly ordered something that was deemed off-limits, we were made to feel like buffoons.After we finally managed to figured out what was available, we ordered and pulled up to the window. You don't need a crystal ball to figure out what happened next--that's right, they got the order partially wrong. One of my wife's Chicken McNuggets even wound up outside of the container. Perhaps it was in a hurry to escape an environment completely void of any sort of concern for the customer, or perhaps they couldn't be bothered to take an extra second to close the container fully. I'll let you be the judge on that one. They also gave her the wrong sauce. I had no idea that ""Sweet and Sour"" actually means ""Barbeque.""Why we stopped at this McDonald's instead of driving to the McDonald's on Clark--which consistently provides amazing customer service that surely makes Ray Kroc smile in his grave--is beyond me.

People were pulling up behind me and I was losing my patience. Finally some lady came on the intercom and said ""What can I get you?"" As if they were the ones waiting on me to decide. I could hear a lot of noise in the background (sounded chaotic). I asked for a grilled chicken wrap. She responded with ""We don't have grilled meat, wait yeah ok grilled what else?"" Then I asked for Sprite. ""We're out of Sprite."" Ok please give me unsweet ice tea. ""OK Sweet tea."" At that point, my headache was so bad I didn't even try to ask for the frickin unsweet tea. Then she told me to drive forward without telling me a total. As I'm waiting to pay and get my food, I see at least two cars leave the drive thru line because they're fed up with the poor service. When I got to the window, the lady even made a comment about it ""Ooooh look at all those cars leaving."" I'm sorry, but if you are aware that you are losing customers, maybe you should step it up a little bit and get your shit together so you don't lose customers. She couldn't have cared less.

1119,"This is the McDonald's that my friends and I always go to since it's the closest to our apartment but at the same time, it's definitely the WORST one I've ever been to.One plus is that their drive-thru is open 24 hours but sadly, the later at night you go, the more often your choices are limited. For example, one day we were craving their vanilla cone but they said that their ice cream machine was off already so they couldn't make it! Okay. What's the point of staying open 24 hours if you can't even give the customers the food they want?!The other day, I had a pretty bad dine-in experience. The lady behind the counter charged extra for big mac sauce on the McDouble which I have NEVER experienced before. Usually going through drive-thru, they never charge extra for a McDouble w/o the ketchup, w/ big mac sauce and shredded lettuce (a.k.a a Big Mac, but cheaper!). My boyfriend and I were pretty shocked when she told us we had to pay extra for the sauce and she claimed that they always do this which they really NEVER DO!!Then, this same lady proceeded to close the cash register before giving me my change! She told me to wait on the side so she can give it to me after she opens it for the next customer. So I patiently waited... and then she closed the cash register AGAIN after the next customer and totally forgot to give me my change!!!! So I had to remind her again to which she just laughed and semi-apologized and then finally gave me my change after like a decade of waiting! ARGH! Worst McDonalds worker ever!! Completely rude and horrible customer service skills! I totally agree with my boyfriend who said this McDonalds is very poorly managed.

1213,"Not to madly contradict what others are saying, but in fairness the location is in an industrial part of downtown L.A. in the Produce Market area. At night, the area is pretty desolate until the early morning hours of around 3 or 4 in the morning when the area comes alive. Now I will admit that the proximity to the Greyhound station isn't attracting the typical McDonalds crowd, and I expect they sell more Dollar Menu items than they do Happy Meals. And it wouldn't be my first choice ordinarily, but the other McDonalds at Olympic and Central was closed due to remodeling on a night I was really craving some fries on the way home. So I put on my bold face (the one that says ""don't ask me S**T!"") and figured I'd tough it out at Alameda and 7th. It was around 9:00pm on a weeknight.When I pulled in, I noticed how brightly lit it was. And while there seemed to be a few cars in the drive thru, none of them looked like they were waiting for very long. Seeing the same type of buzz inside, I decided to go inside and walk up to the counter.When I got inside, I can only guess someone there reads Yelp reviews. It was ridiculously clean, they seemed to have adequate staff on hand, and they moved very efficiently.

1301,"Located on the border of the West and Greenwich village, this McDonald's restaurant (which according to wikipedia is a part of the world's largest chain of hamburger fast food restaurants) is in a prime location.While the decor is a little dated, it reflects the some of the architecture and older buildings in the village. ξThere is also a great hanging mural of basketball players located above the register and can be better viewed while dining on the second floor of the establishment (the art most likely drew inspiration from the West 4th street courts located across from the restaurant, paying homage to the locals).Instead of order from a waiter you order individually through the designated cash registers, while this may seem like more work it does save you some extra cash and also lets you customize your order directly without having to go through another person. ξThe menu itself has it's staples, 'The Big Mac' , 'Filet-O-Fish', 'McNuggets' and of course the french fries which are all bargains for the amount of food you receive when compared to other restaurants. ξThere is also an ever changing rotation of new sandwich, wraps, salads and other specialty items; all of which have the same McDonald's quality.This past visit I ordered a McDouble, a large french fires and a 4 piece McNuggets. ξThe food was ready for me in under five minutes, a time almost unheard of at other restaurants. I took a seat at the upstairs section and started with the McDouble. The McDouble included two cooked beef patties, cheese, pickles, ketchup and chopped onions, very satisfying for under 2 dollars. ξI then switched between the hot crispy french fries and the McNuggets (small deep fried pieces of chicken) which I dipped in ketchup and their very tasty honey mustard sauce. ξAll in all I was very full and content with my meal, all of which cost me under $10, at any other local restaurant just a burger and fries would have run me more than $10 and most likely closer to $15.Although the food may not be on par, quality wise with other nearby eateries (Minetta Tavern, 100 Acres and Market Table), essentially you are getting a full meal at nearly half the price and a quarter of the time.

I've never had such slow service at any McDonalds, and I've never had such slow service in Manhattan. I never thought I'd face this AT a McDonalds IN Manhattan. When a new line opened up, the server deliberately ignored me and called out in Spanish to a man who had been waiting in another line less than one minute, avoiding eye contact with me the whole time. I got on line behind him. She chit-chatted with him and then went and got his food herself instead of letting the staff in the back do it. Another 5 minutes. By the time I got to the front of the line, no ""welcome"", not even a smile for me. I ordered my breakfast. She took my money and then proceeded to take the next two orders--this time, of course, having the staff (which themselves were working at a snail's pace) get my food.

1467,"A McDonalds's with the worst continuing costumer service I have ever experienced on multiple occasions over the course of three years. Let's just say an average wait for a small fry is 25 minutes.Last night at 3:30 AM I pulled up to the drive-thru, just as a car was reversing out. I should have known then that I was warned. I continued to pull through, but after ten minutes or so no one asked me for my order. So I continued on through the drive thru, thinking I could order at the next window. Well actually I sat trapped in the drive thru for over thirty minutes with the line not moving, and my car not able to escape the raised drive thru. At one point an older male employee came to the first window, stood there, looked at me and laughed. Then he turned around and left (I assume to continue not doing work.)After a waste of 30 minutes, the car behind me left and I was able to reverse my way out. So I have a few recommendations: 1. Since your McDonalds sucks so much please do not barricade drive thru attendees without an escape route. 2. Learn how to make 'fast' food and 3. Fire your entirely incompetent staff. You're wasting your money.This place doesn't even deserve one star.

1468,Be afraid be very afraid. The costumer service sucks big time specially if you are not black and there is an african american attendant. I have seen people getting hook ups based on their race and I have to pay full price?!! WTF. The managers are the rudest and when you order extra tomatoes or in my case onions you don't get what you pay extra for is like they don't compute. I saw a lady ordering a shake and when they go grab the empty cup to make it they stuck their dirty hand inside the cup EWWW!. Then you have people that don't speak English working the counter explain to me how that makes sense. Slow service and the teachers from the school I work at have gotten their identification stolen after using their credit cards here. I am sure it was one of their cousins running the scam.

1523,"Two points right out of the gate: 1. Thuggery knows no race (lily white frat boys from the suburbs can be just as vulgar and aggressive as any group with a gang mentality) 2. Rating a McDonald's and McDonald's food isn't really an essential service; people generally know what they're getting - menu and quality wise - going in. The purpose of this review is mostly about the safety factor. People need to know (and I think locals already do) that, depending on the time of day (night), this place is marginally dangerous. Over my last three visits to Chicago, I've noticed this neighborhood being overrun by flash mobs who do more looting, aggressive panhandling, and fighting than choreographed performing. In fact, this particular McDonald's had to be closed down for several hours a couple months ago while police attempted to restore order. The Water Tower Place Mall about a block away has seen an increase in gang activity lately, including the arrest of some armed teenagers. This isn't just my take (check out some of the other reviews of this place and this neighborhood). Many are pointing out that the Mag Mile is slowly becoming the ""Mug Mile."" And this McDonald's seems to be ground zero for Hip Hop Nation as they pour off the Red Line after taking up two seats on the subway while grandma has to stand. Apologists and the agenda driven will say (and have said): ""These kids are guilty of nothing other than being black in a predominantly white neighborhood."" Really? Since when does being authentically ""black"" include screaming nonstop obscenities with little kids around (black and white)? Since when did Chicago get so soft on youth crime? Since when did it become open season on civility? [Since when did my reviews start reading like the rantings of some terrified reactionary/fascist?] While it's mildly funny that Katelyn, Emily, Ashley, and their dolly buying mommies must sometimes contend with this thuggery after they leave the American Girl Doll store, nobody (not even the over-privileged, country club set) should have to endure this genuinely menacing behavior.
